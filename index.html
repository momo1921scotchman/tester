        <h2>Heading Two</h2>
        <p>Here is another paragraph. Some gibberish to make this longer. Twinkle twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are up above the world so high. Like a diamond in the sky. My typing skills are out of practice. 
        Just testing to see if I can have a paragraph inside the element paragraph. <em>a/n it doesnt work</em> Is it better to do another line? <strong>have to do another p element</strong> Just keep typing. I want another energy drink. Yadda Yadda. I dont know what to say. Is there a way to spell check in this app? This is a longer paragraph. It can include multiple sentences and span many lines. The Barbie movie was a fun watch. Still running out of things to say. I wonder how long this looks now. 
        </p>
        <p>My first site idea still needs completing. My family want to look at it. Will probably take awhile. I wonder if this is long enough. Selena Gomez is a bop. Nanananana nananana. I give up next line is gonna be song lyrics. - add on this is now being added to the header
